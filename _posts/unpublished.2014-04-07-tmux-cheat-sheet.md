Tmux is a terminal program that allows you have windows and persistent sessions.
Let's put that a bit simpler. Have you ever been working on the command line and
wished that you could open up two panes side by side? Have you ever accidentally
closed the command line terminal and lost your work? Tmux solves both those
problems, and a whole lot more. It's a indispensable tool for anyone who works
on the command line.
