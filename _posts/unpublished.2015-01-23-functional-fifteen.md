"Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning."
- Edsger Dijkstra

Functional programming is all the rage these days. It's hard to go to a
conference, water cooler, or your grandmas house without hearing about it. To
initiates it's an insurmountable wall within which are swaths of intellectual
giants and the answer to all your bugs. To learners it's the great mind twist
that forces them to revisit and rethink many of the premises upon which their
craft was learned. Beyond that stage I can only surmise. Is programming nirvana
really found in functional programming? I honestly don't know yet, but I'm
making 2015 the year I find out. Here is the story of my journey.

In school I learned object oriented programming in languages like Java and C#.
Once I joined the work force, I landed in a job that demanded SQL chops almost
exclusively. SQL quickly became a gateway drug back into real programming and
that's when I relearned JavaScript. JavaScript was one of the best decisions I
made early in my career. Not because it's an elegant language, but because it's
melting pot of ideas.

In JavaScript you're constantly bombarded with new approaches, libraries, and
frameworks. There is a certain stamina you have to maintain to keep your
sanity. The moment you find yourself comfortable with something, it gets
replaced with something better (hopefully). For many, that is their primary
complaint about web programming. For me, and many of the people I've worked
with, it's what gets us up in the morning. There is an underlying attitude that
is always willing to approach problems from new angles, a constant quest for
near perfection.
