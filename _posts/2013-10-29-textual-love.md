A few months ago a friend of mine got me setup with an account on his Linux
box. This meant I had to relearn a ton of the basic Linux commands I hadn't
used since high school. At first I was pretty frustrated. It was hard to get
anything done. But I liked the idea of a slim development machine running in
the cloud. One that I could leave on as long as I wanted. One that I could
connect to from any machine. Since most of my development is just fancy text
editing, I knew I had to step up me game.

## Vim

Step one was to learn Vim. Vim is a text editor that you can practically turn
into an IDE. It's modal, meaning that the same keyboard shortcuts do different
things depending on what "mode" you are in. That is probably one of the biggest
barriers to entry. What I didn't realize was that Vim was the answer to *all*
my problems with writing text, whether it be code or a blog post. In summary,
if you want to be a text editing and code writing wizard, learn Vim. It's worth
every painful minute while learning. 

### Learning Resources

- [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) is an in-browser game that helps
