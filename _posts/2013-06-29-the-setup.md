# The Setup

I've been setup! Setup with some epic software... It took me a long time to figure out what tools actually help me be more productive, but now I've got it. Here is a list of my favorite tools, and some of the reasons I love them.

### [Evernote](http://evernote.com)

###### Free

Evernote is pretty much my second brain. I keep all my notes, receipts, and any other info I need to remember in it. If you don't have Evernote, or some kind of alternative, you should really try it.

### [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com)

###### Free trial, unbounded

Sublime Text 2 is my text and code editor of choice. In conjunction with Will Bond's [package manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can pretty much have it all in Sublime Text. I especially love the "vintage mode" that gives me VIM like keyboard shortcuts.

### [Spotify](http://spotify.com)

###### Free

I love listening to music. Spotify is the best music streaming service I've found. Very rarely does it not have a song I'm looking for. I pay 10$ a month to be able to use it on my phone, but otherwise it's free (with light ads).

### [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)

###### Free

Chrome is my browser of choice. I have come to rely on the developer tools. They are invaluable for web developers.

### [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)

###### Free, private GitHub repositories cost $

When it comes to source control, I don't think git can be beat. When I started coding I went with Microsoft's TFS. Which isn't terrible for a centralized source control, but it's heavily tied to Visual Studio, which I don't care much for. Git rocked my world when I realized how easy it is to use. Getting started can be a bit difficult, try starting [here](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

### [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/)

###### Costs $, Windows & Linux

Beyond Compare is a great tool for showing you the different between files. It integrates well with Git and other source control. It doesn't have to be used with a source control system. 

Hopefully you enjoyed my short breakdown of the tools I use. Go check them out!
