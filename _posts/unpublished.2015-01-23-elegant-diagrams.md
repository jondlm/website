Talk about what graphviz is and why it's hard to learn. Mention the dot
language.

Talk about why I love it so much. Akin to the feeling I had when finding and
learning markdown.

Talk about installation and basic rendering.

    brew install graphviz
    dot -o adjustments.png adjustments.dot -Tpng

Go through basic graphs and directed graphs. Basic syntax.

Reference good learning page: http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#a:dpi

Write a few examples with `.dot` code.
