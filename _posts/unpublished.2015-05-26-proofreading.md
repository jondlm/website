I can't tell you number of times I've seen "communication" cited as one of the
reasons a candidate is hired. Clear and effective written communication is
essential for any career. Being a developer does not make me exempt from that
reality. Over the past several months I've been trying out a new technique I
came up with to reduce the number of typos and grammatical mistakes in my
writing. I even went so far as to collect data on how my new technique compares
with my old method of proofreading. Unfortunately I quickly realized that I was
skewing the data, so I won't include any of that nonsense.

The proofreading technique I've come up with involves using a simple word
highlighting trick along with reading aloud in your head to find more mistakes.
I'm sure a lot of people don't know that if they put their text cursor at the
beginning of a paragraph and press "shift-alt-right-arrow" repeatedly, a single
word at a time will be highlighted. Perhaps it's better to illustrate this:
