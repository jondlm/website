title: Reboot

I was at Stripe for four years. I loved my team, found the work fun, and had a close relationship with my manager. I quit at the end of September. I was in dire need of a reboot.

I'm in the middle of a cataclysmic shift in my life. Technology and work have always provided a sense of stability; a sense of identity. I can feel my relationship with them changing dramatically. I used to tell people "I'm a software engineer" with a sense of internal pride. I see things differently now. I've needed to start _really_ asking the question: what do I care about?

Take a peek at my [values](/values) page to learn more about what I've discovered so far.

In the last couple years I've started taking writing more seriously. I've started to write stories from my childhood. I've even begun to share them with a [group of people](https://theallendercenter.org/store/products/to-be-told/). Though it's hard for me to believe, I actually enjoy writing now.

I'm not sure where I'm going to take this site. I have a bunch of technical content I've written over the years that I may mold into something useful here. I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build/) which has honestly been a breath of fresh air compared to Hugo so the barrier to publishing is razor thin.
