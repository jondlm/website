It's not often I need to work on low-level sourcemap stuff, but I do I reach for this tool.

[evanw](https://github.com/evanw) wrote a really nice tool to debug sourcemaps: https://evanw.github.io/source-map-visualization/

There's also a handy dandy speedscope tool for _fast_ profiles (evan also has contributed): https://speedscope.app
