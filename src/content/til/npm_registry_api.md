In my work I've often needed to dig into the npm registry API or emulate parts
of it. Turns out it's [well
documented](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md#get-v1search)
but hard to find cause it's a markdown file in a git repo. Figured I'd leave
this breadcrumb for future me.
