I learned today about the [evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr/blob/main/evcxr_repl/README.md) project. It allows you to run a Rust REPL. I find it extremely handy for learning and toying around with various standard library stuff.

It's also got a Jupyter Notebook plugin but I don't currently care about that.

There's also [irust](https://github.com/sigmaSd/IRust) but it's got some tradeoffs.
