    Why would anyone do this?
  </p>
  <p>
    That's what I would have asked myself a couple years ago. I'm still not
    totally sure. Lately I feel drawn to pondering what matters most to me.
    Companies seem to care a lot about these. Why shouldn't I?
  </p>

  <h2 class={h2Class}>Stories matter</h2>
  <p>
    Humans thrive on narrative. Each life is itself a complex story that walks
    the interplay of beauty and tragedy. Shared stories form a foundation for
    connection that creates something greater than the sum of the parts. I take
    time to slow down, ponder, write my stories, and share some of them.
  </p>

  <h2 class={h2Class}>Tech as a tool</h2>
  <p>
    The tech I build protects well-being and promotes human flourishing. Tech
    should never exploit weaknesses no matter how well intentioned. A good
    hammer sits quietly ready in the belt of the worker. It doesn't send
    disruptive notifications.
  </p>

  <h2 class={h2Class}>Relationships over metrics</h2>
  <p>
    The dashboard of a car is undeniably helpful. It displays important data
    that helps me drive safely. It's easy to become so entranced by the numbers
    on the screen that I miss the person crossing the street in front of me and
    cause real damage. I am considerate about which metrics I gather, how they
    could affect people, and how I steward them once they're gathered.
  </p>

  <h2 class={h2Class}>Pen and paper</h2>
  <p>
    Screens are incredible and powerful. If left unchecked, they naturally
    outpace my humanity. Often the best approach to solving a problem requires
    the courage to stop, pull out a piece of paper, and let my mind slowly
    wander the grounds of a problem space.
  </p>

  <h2 class={h2Class}>Curiosity breeds creativity</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    Questions born of genuine curiosity are powerful. Toyota developed the
    concept of the "Five whys." The idea is that if you keep asking why enough
    times you'll eventually get to the root cause. Neat, but why stop at five?
    Why not pull others into the question asking process? Why not examine my
    reasons for asking the questions I ask? I am unashamedly curious! If I find
    myself not feeling curious, I ask... why?
  </p>
  <p>
    I am wary of fake questions. It's easy to make demands or statements
    disguised as questions.
  </p>

  <h2 class={h2Class}>Humbling honesty</h2>
  <p>
    Honesty is expensive. There are good reasons I seldom offer it. I value the
    honesty I extend and when others extend it to me. I know that fostering an
    environment of honesty will invariably humble me but it's worth the risk.
