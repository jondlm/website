Recently I started learning Ruby on Rails. Mainly because it's in high demand
and ruby is supposed to be a clean, expressive language. Just being honest.
It's been pretty interesting so far. I started my professional programming
journey in javascript and node, which has a very different philosophy than
rails. In *node land*, the community respects small modules that have clearly
defined responsibilities. It's the developers job to string those small modules
together to create something cohesive. *Frameworks* are generally looked down
upon. Well, rails takes a very different approach. It happens to be a giant
framework that bundles a ton of modules together for you.

The last website I built was on top of the express.js node framework. Express
is a pretty minimal framework. It doesn't give you all the bells and whistles
that rails does. One of the big pain points I had was managing forms.
Particularly with keeping the "create" page and the "update" pages in sync.
Perhaps I was missing something in the express framework to help out. Early on
with rails they showed the proper way to maintain a single view for both your
"update" and "edit" forms. It was pretty thrilling to see they had already
solved a problem I had and it came included with the package. On the other
hand, I bet there's a module out there that helps with just that issue.

I'm not sure I buy into either the "completely small modules" or "giant
framework" philosophies. There are times when having features included in a
framework can save a ton of time. There are other times when I want custom
functionality that the framework author didn't anticipate, it's in those
moments I wish I had small modules.  Hopefully by learning rails I'll be able
to have a more informed opinion on the heated debate.
