## HAYR: Highlight as You Read

I can't tell you the number of times I've seen "communication" cited as one of the
reasons a candidate is hired. Clear and effective written communication is
essential for any career. Being a developer does not make me exempt. Over the
past six months I've been trying out a new technique to reduce the number of
typos and grammatical mistakes in my writing. I even went so far as to collect
data on how my new technique compares with my old method of proofreading.
Unfortunately I soon realized I was skewing the data, so I won't include any of
that nonsense.

My new proofreading technique uses a simple word highlighting trick along with
reading aloud in my head to find more mistakes. I'll bet a lot of people don't
know that if they put their text cursor at the beginning of a paragraph and
press "shift-alt-right-arrow" (Mac) or "ctrl-shift-right-arrow" (Windows)
repeatedly, it will highlight a single word at a time. Perhaps it's better to
illustrate this with a GIF:

There's really not much more to say. I've found the HAYR method dramatically
decreases the number of typos in my writing. Give it a shot and let me know if
it helps!

P.S. I'm feeling pretty insecure about typos in this post, which is part of the
reason it's so short.
