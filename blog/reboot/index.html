I loved my team, enjoyed the work, and had a close relationship with my manager. I quit at the end of August. I was burned out and struggling to sleep. Not because the job was too stressful, it felt more like I was fighting an invisible internal battle that demanded action. I was in dire need of a reboot.</p>
<p>I’m in the middle of a cataclysmic shift in my life. Technology and work have always provided a sense of stability; a sense of identity. My relationship with them is changing dramatically. I used to tell people “I’m a software engineer” with thinly veiled pride. I see things differently now. I’ve needed to start <em>really</em> asking the question: what do I care about?</p>
<p>Take a peek at my <a href="/website/values">values</a> page to learn more about what I’ve discovered so far.</p>
<p>In the last couple years I’ve started taking writing more seriously. I’ve started writing stories from my childhood. I’ve begun sharing them with a group of people. Though it’s hard for me to believe, I actually enjoy writing now.</p>
<p>For this iteration of my site I’m using <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> which has been a breath of fresh air - compared to Hugo - making the barrier to publishing razor thin.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where I’m going to take this site. I have a bunch of technical content I’ve written over the years that I may mold into something useful here. I may publish some of my writing that’s not technical. I may even abandon the site and forget about it until I need to update my resume 😑. We’ll see!</p>
<p>Either way, I’m aware of the temptation to treat these kinds of blog endeavors as connection. For me, it isn’t real connection. I appreciate that you’re reading this, but it’s no substitute for getting to know each other. Contrary to the suggestion of social media, relationships don’t scale.</p>
<p>Cheers to small things 🍻.</p> </article>  </body></html>
