## The Skinny 

I'm a web developer and consultant living and working in Portland,
Oregon. I'm all about high tech and the open web. Between helping clients, I
spend a lot of time learning new technologies; I'm always searching for "the
most effective." It's more a mentality than a destination. My technical
background is diverse, ranging from enterprise SQL Server data warehousing to
responsive front-end design to Node.js. I prefer open source when possible;
it's beautiful when done well. Feel free to contact me, I'm always up for a
good conversation!

And now, allow me to bore you with the details of my life...


### My Past

While growing up, I always loved technology. I learned to convince my parents
to buy the "latest and greatest" gadgets, when possible, so I could feed my burning
desire for 1s and 0s. In high school, I did two years of the Cisco Networking
Academy. I got to play with stuff ranging from gigantic 32 port hubs to quad
processor (when I was a kid this was nuts) Sun servers. This love eventually
developed in to a career choice when I began the computer science program at
Oregon State University in 2006. After completing my first year in computer
science, I realized I loved interacting with humans as well as computers. In
light of this, I changed my major to business information systems to discover a
meaningful fusion between business and computing. Three years later I completed
my college education with a semester abroad in Sweden. Currently I have a BS in
business information systems and international business.


### My Middle 

In case you were wondering why I referred to myself as a routard, it's a French
word for 'traveler'. A consequence of having a father who isn't from the US is
getting to visit relatives outside the country. In my life I've been blessed
with the desire and the means to see the world. From a young age my family
began visiting France. The language always interested me but I never really
learned it until recently. After studying abroad in Sweden during the winter of
2010, I had the opportunity to live with my grandma and self-study French for
three months.


### My Present 

I eventually ended up in Portland after my adventures
abroad. That's when I met my lovely wife. And as they say, the rest was
history. I now work as a consultant for CSG Pro here in Portland where I am
focused on data visualization. I am passionate about data and technology. So
much so, I often learn it in my spare time; I even dream about it. Yikes.

Most importantly, I love Jesus. I love everything about Him. I keep asking Him
to change me, from the inside out, to be more like Him. It's a journey I'll be
on until I die. And it's the best journey to be found.
