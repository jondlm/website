# Jon de la Motte's Blog

This repo contains the files that my statically generated, personal blog runs
off. I am using Netlify and Hugo. Merged to master are automatically built and
deployed.

## Thanks

Thanks to the following projects for providing the great software I used:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
