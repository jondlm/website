# The Blog of Jon de la Motte

This repo contains the files that my statically generated, personal blog runs
off. I am using GitHub pages and Jekyll. Jekyll is awesome, you should try it.

## Thanks

Thanks to the following projects for providing the great software I used:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [HPSTR Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme)
